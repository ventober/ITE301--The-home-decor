# ITE301--The-home-decor

This is a landing application where customers can select marvelous designs right for their home-interiors. The app is under the industries for : renovators, real estates, and just having the freedom to flex their living room on social media.

to Run, assure that both android studio and, flutter extensions is present in your IDE of choice. Although it is optional to have the two but if you want to view the app in an emulator it is required to access android studio SDK manager.Addition to that, if you prefer the browser to view you must not forget to include more fetch permissions (on vs code). Without further, there are two ways to do this but i suggest if you had VS code prepared just click on the terminal and write first - cd 'folder directory'and followed by the flutter command 'flutter run'.

Note since this was executed on our device you need to downgrade your svg version to old (i think maybe 0.17.04) for dart or simply replace drawn function for local variables(the image roots).
